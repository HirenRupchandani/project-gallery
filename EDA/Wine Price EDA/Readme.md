### **3.2 Data Cleaning**

- In this section, we performed the **cleaning** operations on the data using information from the previous section.
- We saw that **price** had a **right-skewed distribution**.
- We  performed **log-transformation** to treat these outliers.
- Apart from that there were **no missing** and **duplicate values** found in the dataset.

- The data was **successfully studied** and hence, the **insights** were **marked down** in order to make proper **business decisions**.
- **Cuyo** has the least **number of records** with **region_1**.
- **Montrachet** has the highest **number of records** with **all the designations**.
- **Cabernet Shiraz** has the highest **number of records** with **all the varieties**.
- **Clos du Mesnil** has the highest **price** amongst **all the designations**.
- **England** has the highest number of **price**.
- **England** has the highest number of **points**.
- **Cuyo** can be a very good target spot depending upon the data and it can be targetted as the prime production units.
- This how the company will save huge cost in production and maintenance.
- Eventually this will lead them to a good amount of profit.
- **Cabernet Shiraz** has the highest amount of demand in the marketspace.
- hence, the production for this winery is a must. The company should **multiply the production** for this **winery** based upon **best resources** and thus is expected to **gain tremendous** amount of **profit**.
